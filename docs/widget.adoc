Our widget show addition information that is provided by google analytics:

We will need to setup a google cloud platform account. 

* link:https://console.developers.google.com/project[Open Google Developers Console]. 
When you are doing click Create Project on the dashboard.

We suggest to use the site or organization name: eg. "site.com", "brand name" 

image::images/ga_02.png[New project form with placeholder text in the fields]

After creating the project open the top level menu in the top right and open "APIs & Services" -> Dashboard

image::images/Platform-menu-api.png[Shows the top level menu open and the APIs & Services item expanded]

We want to enable a couple of APIs so press the "+ eneable APIs and services" on the top of the page:

image::images/apis-services.png[Show the button labeled "+ Enable apis and services"]

On the go api Library search for "Google Analytics Reporting Api". 
It should look like this: 

image::images/analytics-api.png[Shows The google analytics api in the search result]

And enable it: 

image::images/analytics-api-enable.png[Shows the analytics api page with an enable button]

And the same two steps for the Maps JavaScript API

After enabling the Maps JavaScript API go to the credentials tab.

And press the "+ Create credentials" button.

We want to create an api key: 

image::images/api-key.png[Dropdown of different authentications]

After creating it make sure to copy it. We will use this value later.

We also need a service account. This is created on the dropdown on the above image. 

This will propmt you to create a new service account. Feel free to give this any name. 

image::images/service-account.png[A new service account dialog with placeholder tekst]

Give the account the viewer role. Create the new account as the final step.

After you have created the account you should be brought back to the overview page.

image::images/service-overview.png[The list of service accounts]

Copy the email of the service account we will need twice later.

Now that we have created an account we need to add give it access to our project.

Go back to our Analytics page, and the property that you want the apis to work with. 
Then enter the property access managment page.

image::images/Analytics-property.png[Analytics overview the property column with the property access management at the bottom]

On this page you can add new users and give them access to this property. 
We want to add our service account to give access to this property

image::images/property-new-user.png[Dropdown on the property access page that shows create a new user]

Now add the service account to the users that have access to the property.
It only needs `read & Analyse` access

image::images/new-user-service.png[A new user form filled in and showing the app button in the top right]

Go back to the cloud platform and the service accounts menu option. Press on the service that was created.

image::images/service-page-accounts.png[Service accounts in a list]

On the service find the tab that is called keys. 
And add a new key. 

image:images/service-keys.png[Show the keys tab with an add key button]

We need to create a new p12 key. This file gives services access, so be careful to not share or send it to others. Only those that need access to it.

Now for our widget to be setup we need to add this information to our configuration file: 
`com.enonic.app.ga.cfg`: 

```
ga.serviceAccount = <service-account>
ga.p12KeyPath = ${xp.home}/config/ga_key.p12
ga.mapsApiKey = <maps-api-key>
```

Where:
 `service-account` is the email for our service and 
 `mapsApiKey` is the maps api key we have created
 and the p12 key with the correct name and path. (Need to add the p12 key to the folder too)
